# Bank Marketing Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree

## Project Overview
This project builds a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product/service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The model is trained using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

##  Dataset
- Name: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- Type: Tabular data
- Target variable: `y` (yes/no – whether the customer subscribed)

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Model Used
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset
2. Preprocessed the data and encoded categorical features
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Decision Tree classifier
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

##  Results
The model successfully classifies customers into potential buyers and non-buyers with good accuracy, showing that Decision Trees can be effectively used for customer purchase prediction and marketing decision support.
